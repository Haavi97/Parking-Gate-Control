# Parking-Gate-Control using ESP-01
> Parking gate automatization using an ESP8266 module and a relay. 


## Hardware
- ESP-01 or ESP-01S or ESP-14 (AI Cloud inside). Tested in all those
- Relay module
- Power converter (2x)
- Capacitors 100Î¼F (2x)
- Female 2.5mm power socket or whatever power input. Later is converted.

## Software
Programmed used Arduino IDE.

## Resources 
- Inspired in Rui Santos [code](https://RandomNerdTutorials.com/)

## Internet connection
Static rout in the router to the local IP address (e.g.: 192.168.1.2) with the port (8888 in the code). That static route depends on each router, but in any case access to the router configuration is required. 
There are other methods like using pipes but that has not been used in this project.
